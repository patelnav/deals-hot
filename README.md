# Deals - Hot

I enjoy browsing RedFlagDeals, unfortunately like most Forums, their sorting sucks. This will use a "Hot" sorting algorithm and re-order posts.

Currently only supports [RedFlagDeals](http://forums.redflagdeals.com/hot-deals-f9/?pp=200)

TODO: Add support for SlickDeals

TODO: Add support for generic forum
